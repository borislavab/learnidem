## Managing Credentials

To perform the idem operations, we would require credentials of the environment almost always.
Idem suggests the following steps for passing credentials:

{{< tabs "install" >}}
<!--  tab "idem-aws"

Create a `credentials.yaml` file - the `default` profile will be used unless specified in the command or state file:

```yaml
aws:
  default:
    aws_access_key_id: <Your Access Key ID>
    aws_secret_access_key: <Your Secret Access Key>
    region_name: <AWS Region>
```
 /tab  -->
{{< tab "idem-azure-auto" >}}

Create a `credentials.yaml` file - the `default` profile will be used unless specified in the command or state file:

```yaml
azure:
   default:
      client_id: "<Your Client ID>"
      secret: "<Your Secret key>"
      subscription_id: "<Your Subcription Key ID>"
      tenant: "<Your Tenant Key ID>"
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< /tabs >}}


Encrypt the credentials file using the idem encrypt command, this creates a fernet file and outputs an encryption key:

```shell
idem encrypt /path/to/credentials.yaml
```
Please note that the output string from the command above is the key Idem uses for accessing the encrypted credentials fernet file, and that if you update your credentials file, Idem will re-use the existing <b>ACCT_KEY</b> previously generated and defined in your OS.

```shell
<output encryption key>
```

Example:
```shell
DvBsYojgU5gy51CecvhhC7Ywrsq9NL3CSg_XcLMKKn4=
```

Before start using Idem, you need to make sure your session includes the <b>ACCT_KEY</b> & <b>ACCT_FILE</b> OS environment varialbles, otherwise export the encryption key and path to the fernet file as an OS environment variable for your session:

```shell
export ACCT_KEY=<output encryption key>
export ACCT_FILE=/path/to/credentials.yaml.fernet
```
Example:
```shell
export ACCT_KEY=DvBsYojgU5gy51CecvhhC7Ywrsq9NL3CSg_XcLMKKn4=
export ACCT_FILE=/home/demouser/environments/credentials.yaml.fernet
```

Idem securely retrieves the credentials combining those OS environment variables before executing states.<br> 
You can also pass those values as parameters of the [Idem cli](Getting-Started/Basic-Commands/) `--acct-key` and `--acct-file` options while applying the states.

Example:
```shell
idem describe azure.virtual_networks.network_interfaces --acct-key DvBsYojgU5gy51CecvhhC7Ywrsq9NL3CSg_XcLMKKn4= --acct-file /home/demouser/environments/credentials.yaml.fernet
```
## Credentials and Profiles

Credentials can be grouped by Plug-Ins (azure, aws, etc ) and Profiles (within each Plug-Ins section),<br> you can define multiple Plug-Ins and Profiles in a single configuration file (e.g. default, dev, staging, etc).<br> It is recommended to always include/define the "default" profile.<br>

E.g. credentials.yaml file with multiple account profiles.

```yaml
azure:
   default:
      client_id: "<Your Client ID>"
      secret: "<Your Secret key>"
      subscription_id: "<Your Subcription Key ID>"
      tenant: "<Your Tenant Key ID>"
   tmm:
      client_id: "<Your Client ID>"
      secret: "<Your Secret key>"
      subscription_id: "<Your Subcription Key ID>"
      tenant: "<Your Tenant Key ID>"
aws:
  default:
    aws_access_key_id: <Your Access Key ID>
    aws_secret_access_key: <Your Secret Access Key>
    region_name: <AWS Region>
```

With Idem, You use the account profile flag `--acct-profile` to indicate which specific profile and associated set of credentials to be used. Please note that if you don't specific the account profile flag `--acct-profile`, the default profile is going to be always used (if profile default is defined at the configuration yaml)<br>

The following command will instruct [Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) to use the Azure credentials associated to the "default" profile

```shell
idem describe azure.compute.virtual_machines 
```

The following command will instruct [Idem](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) to use the Azure credentials associated to the "tmm" profile  ( per credentials.yaml file from lines above)

```shell
idem describe azure.compute.virtual_machines --acct-profile tmm
```
