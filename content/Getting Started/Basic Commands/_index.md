Idem provides the [idem cli](/Getting-Started/Install-Idem/) which allows to describe resources but also invoke states.<br>
[Idem states](/How-to-use-Idem/States/) are used to make sure resources are in a desired state. The desired state of a resource can be specified in SLS file.

<b>encrypt</b><br>
     Use the acct subsystem to encrypt data, e.g. [Encrypt the credentials file](/getting-started/authenticate/)

```shell
idem encrypt /path/to/credentials.yaml
```

<b>decrypt</b><br>
     Use the acct subsystem to decrypt data, e.g. an existing encrypted credentials file (*.fernet)

```shell
idem decrypt /path/to/credentials_test.yaml.fernet
```

<b>describe</b><br>
    Commands to run description routines, e.g. [Listing and obtaining existing VMs details](/how-to-use-idem/describe/)

```shell
idem describe azure.compute.virtual_machines
```

<b>state</b><br>
    Commands to run idempotent states, e.g. [create, update, and in general manage your resources](/how-to-use-idem/states/) 

```shell
idem state vm_moff_present.sls
```

You will use mostly a combination of <b>describe</b> (Discover status and helper for crafting a state file to update resource) and <b>state</b> commands (for managing the resources states), <br> let's take a closer look to <b>state</b> operations.

<b>exec</b><br>
    Commands to run execution routines, normally used internally in idem code

<b>Present State</b>
    makes sure a <b>resource exists in a desired state</b>. If a resource does not exist, running present will create the resource on the provider. If a resource exists, running present will <b>update</b> the resource on the provider. (Only the values that the Cloud Provider REST API supports can be updated). <br>
    You can indicate this state by adding "<<Your Provider>>.<<Your Provider Resource>><b>.present</b>"
<br>
```shell
my-virtual-network:
azure.virtual_networks.virtual_networks.present:
```

<b>Absent State</b>
    makes sure a <b>resource does not exist</b>. If a resource exits, running absent will <b>delete</b> the resource. If a resource does not exist, running absent is a no-operation<br>
    You can indicate this state by adding "<<Your Provider>>.<<Your Provider Resource>><b>.absent</b>"
<br>
```shell
my-virtual-network:
azure.virtual_networks.virtual_networks.absent:
```
